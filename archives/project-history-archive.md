## Session: March 5, 2025 - Completing Modular Report Generation with Fallbacks in lust-next

In this session, we successfully completed and tested the fixes for the modular reporting architecture in lust-next:

1. **Comprehensive Fallback Mechanisms**:
   - Enhanced `coverage.lua` to add fallback source file tracking when debug hooks fail
   - Implemented manual dataset creation in `run_tests.lua` to ensure reports always generate
   - Added robust input validation throughout the reporting process to handle missing data
   - Created multiple directory creation methods to handle different environment limitations
   - Added extensive diagnostic output to pinpoint issues in the data flow chain

1. **Data Flow Improvements**:
   - Fixed issues with the `get_report_data()` function to always return properly structured data
   - Enhanced the `calculate_stats()` function with better debugging and source tracking
   - Improved the reporting module's input validation to gracefully handle incomplete data
   - Added pattern-based source file detection when debug tracking fails
   - Enhanced file path normalization for better pattern matching and directory handling

1. **Testing and Verification**:
   - Successfully tested the enhanced reporting with HTML, JSON, and LCOV formats
   - Created comprehensive test cases for different failure scenarios
   - Verified backward compatibility with existing API usage patterns
   - Added documentation for the improved reporting module
   - Created examples demonstrating recommended practices for custom reporting

## Session: March 5, 2025 - Implementing Modular Report Generation for lust-next

In this session, we focused on implementing the modular reporting architecture in lust-next:

1. **Reporting Module Implementation**:
   - Created src/reporting.lua as a centralized module for all report generation and file I/O
   - Implemented standardized data interfaces for communication between modules
   - Added multiple report formatters (summary, JSON, HTML, LCOV) for coverage data
   - Added multiple report formatters (summary, JSON, HTML) for quality data
   - Implemented robust file operations with directory creation and error handling
   - Added auto-save functionality for multiple report formats in a single operation

1. **Module Refactoring for Separation of Concerns**:
   - Updated coverage.lua to return structured data instead of generating reports
   - Updated quality.lua to follow the same pattern with proper data structures
   - Maintained backward compatibility with existing module interfaces
   - Added proper error handling and graceful fallbacks throughout
   - Created a consistent pattern across modules for better maintainability

1. **lust-next Integration**:
   - Connected the reporting module with existing functionality in run_tests.lua
   - Added command-line options for controlling report generation
   - Implemented configuration options for customizing reports
   - Added automatic report generation with fallback to ensure reports are always created
   - Enhanced the user experience with better status messages and error reporting

## Session: March 5, 2025 - Updating run_tests.lua in lust-next-testbed for Modular Reporting

In this session, we focused on updating lust-next-testbed to use the new modular reporting architecture:

1. **run_tests.lua Integration**:
   - Updated run_tests.lua to use the new reporting module for report generation
   - Implemented flexible module loading with multiple fallback mechanisms
   - Added support for auto-saving reports in multiple formats
   - Enhanced error handling with proper fallbacks for backward compatibility
   - Improved user feedback with detailed messages about report generation

1. **Dependency Management Improvements**:
   - Created update-deps.sh script to sync latest files from the main lust-next repository
   - Implemented proper submodule update mechanisms
   - Added local dependency checking to ensure modules are available
   - Enhanced reporting module detection logic
   - Ensured compatibility between lust-next and lust-next-testbed

## Session: March 4, 2025 - Module Reset Utilities in lust-next

In this session, we significantly improved the lust-next testing framework with utilities for better module management and enhanced async testing capabilities:

1. **Module Reset Utilities**:
   - Added `reset_module()` function to reload modules and ensure clean state between tests
   - Implemented `with_fresh_module()` for simplified module isolation in tests
   - Reduced boilerplate code in test files with standardized module management
   - Improved test isolation to prevent cross-contamination between test cases
   - Updated documentation with detailed examples and best practices

1. **Enhanced Async Testing**:
   - Added `parallel_async()` function for running multiple async operations concurrently
   - Fixed `wait_until()` to properly throw errors on timeout conditions
   - Enhanced error handling throughout async testing functions
   - Improved wait condition testing with better timeout detection
   - Added comprehensive examples to documentation showing parallel execution patterns

## Session: March 3, 2025 - Comprehensive Testing Plan for lust-next and hooks-util

In this session, we developed a comprehensive testing plan to thoroughly validate the lust-next testing framework and hooks-util integration before implementing them across our Neovim ecosystem:

1. **Structured Test Strategy**:
   - Created an exhaustive testing methodology covering all components and integrations
   - Designed a system of test dummy projects for different project types
   - Planned function-level testing for all public APIs
   - Established coverage and quality validation test scenarios
   - Created a framework for testing the adapter system across project types

1. **Testing Infrastructure Design**:
   - Planned dedicated test repositories for each project type:
     - Pure Lua project for lust-next direct testing
     - Lua library adapter for hooks-util testing
     - Neovim plugin adapter for hooks-util testing
     - Neovim config adapter for hooks-util testing
   - Created specifications for controlled test environments
   - Designed validation strategies for all configuration options
   - Established error case testing methodology

## Session: March 2, 2025 - Test Infrastructure Implementation for lust-next and hooks-util

In this session, we implemented the complete test infrastructure for validating lust-next and hooks-util by creating four specialized test projects:

1. **Test Project Creation**:
   - Created four complete test projects with specialized purposes:
     - `lust-next-testbed`: Pure Lua project for validating core lust-next functionality
     - `hooks-util-testbed-lua-lib`: Lua library project with rockspec for testing Lua library adapter
     - `hooks-util-testbed-nvim-plugin`: Neovim plugin structure for testing plugin adapter
     - `hooks-util-testbed-nvim-config`: Neovim config with init.lua.d for testing config adapter
   - Set up complete project structures with appropriate directory layouts
   - Established proper git repositories for each project for version control

1. **Source File Implementation**:
   - Created source files with deliberate style and lint issues:
     - Inconsistent spacing and indentation for StyLua to detect
     - Global variables and undefined references for Luacheck to flag
     - Excessively long lines for line length limits
     - Unused variables and parameters for static analysis
   - Implemented different module patterns appropriate for each project type
   - Created realistic code that reflects common development patterns
