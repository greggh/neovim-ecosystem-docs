## Session: March 2, 2025 - Test Infrastructure Implementation for lust-next and hooks-util

In this session, we implemented the complete test infrastructure for validating lust-next and hooks-util by creating four specialized test projects:

1. **Test Project Creation**:
   - Created four complete test projects with specialized purposes:
     - `lust-next-testbed`: Pure Lua project for validating core lust-next functionality
     - `hooks-util-testbed-lua-lib`: Lua library project with rockspec for testing Lua library adapter
     - `hooks-util-testbed-nvim-plugin`: Neovim plugin structure for testing plugin adapter
     - `hooks-util-testbed-nvim-config`: Neovim config with init.lua.d for testing config adapter
   - Set up complete project structures with appropriate directory layouts
   - Established proper git repositories for each project for version control

2. **Source File Implementation**:
   - Created source files with deliberate style and lint issues:
     - Inconsistent spacing and indentation for StyLua to detect
     - Global variables and undefined references for Luacheck to flag
     - Excessively long lines for line length limits
     - Unused variables and parameters for static analysis
   - Implemented different module patterns appropriate for each project type
   - Created realistic code that reflects common development patterns
