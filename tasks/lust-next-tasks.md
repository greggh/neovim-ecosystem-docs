# Lust-Next Tasks

## Current Focus

The current focus for lust-next is enhancing the modular reporting architecture and completing all remaining items for reliable report generation.

## High Priority Tasks

1. **Improve Reporting Module**
   - [ ] Create additional isolated test cases for comprehensive validation of the reporting module
   - [ ] Add Cobertura XML output format for integration with more CI systems
   - [ ] Enhance HTML reports with source code highlighting and better navigation
   - [ ] Add configuration support for report file naming and location specification
   - [ ] Create comprehensive validation suite for validating all module interactions

2. **Error Handling and Edge Cases**
   - [ ] Improve error handling for temporary file creation failures
   - [ ] Add better fallbacks for environments with restricted file permissions
   - [ ] Enhance pattern matching for more precise file inclusion/exclusion
   - [ ] Implement graceful degradation for partial data situations

3. **Documentation Enhancement**
   - [ ] Create comprehensive examples for all reporting output formats
   - [ ] Update API documentation with the latest reporting module changes
   - [ ] Add troubleshooting guide for common reporting issues
   - [ ] Create visual guide for interpreting coverage and quality reports

## Medium Priority Tasks

1. **Performance Benchmarking Module**
   - [ ] Implement benchmark runner functionality with precise timing
   - [ ] Create timing utilities with nanosecond precision when available
   - [ ] Support benchmark suites with multiple test cases
   - [ ] Add statistical analysis of benchmark results (mean, median, std dev)
   - [ ] Implement comparison between benchmark runs
   - [ ] Create visual benchmark reports in HTML format
   - [ ] Add performance regression detection
   - [ ] Support profiling integration for deeper analysis

2. **Performance Optimization**

   - [ ] Implement report merging for distributed test execution

4. **Usability Enhancements**
   - [ ] Add progress indicators during report generation
   - [ ] Improve report file organization with configurable structures
   - [ ] Create report comparison utilities to track improvements

## Low Priority Tasks

1. **Advanced Features**
   - [ ] Add support for Git integration in reports (show who last modified lines)
   - [ ] Implement historical trend tracking for coverage and quality metrics
   - [ ] Create dashboard view for multi-project report aggregation

2. **Extensibility**
   - [ ] Add plugin system for custom report formats
   - [ ] Create hooks for pre/post report generation
   - [ ] Implement custom metrics collection framework
