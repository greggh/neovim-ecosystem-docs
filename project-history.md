   - Strong emphasis on command pattern best practices, especially avoiding `cd`

## Session: March 6, 2025 - Documentation Reorganization Plan Implementation

In this session, we implemented a comprehensive documentation reorganization plan to reduce context length while maintaining all important information:

1. **Tiered Documentation System**:
   - Created a three-tiered documentation structure:
     - Tier 1: Essential context (ecosystem-overview.md)
     - Tier 2: Current status (project-status.md and project-specific task files)
     - Tier 3: Reference materials (specs, plans, and history)
   - Implemented centralized documentation in `/home/gregg/Projects/docs-projects/neovim-ecosystem-docs/`
   - Created documentation-reorganization-plan.md with detailed structure
   - Added task files for all projects in the ecosystem
   - Created architecture specifications and implementation plans

1. **Standardized CLAUDE.md**:
   - Created CLAUDE.md.template for consistent format
   - Updated all project CLAUDE.md files to follow the new template
   - Ensured consistent sections across all projects:
     - Project overview
     - Essential commands
     - Project structure
     - Current focus
     - Documentation links

1. **Session Prompts**:
   - Created startup-prompt.md for beginning new sessions efficiently
   - Developed end-of-session.md for comprehensive documentation updates
   - Planned additional prompts for common workflows (project initialization, feature implementation)
   - Added documentation tasks file to track documentation system development

1. **Documentation Migration**:
   - Moved content from lengthy project-summary.md to focused, purpose-specific files
   - Created dedicated task files to track progress for individual projects
   - Extracted architectural information into separate specification documents
   - Corrected chronology issues in historical records

## Session: March 6, 2025 - Fixing Modular Report Generation in lust-next

In this session, we focused on debugging and fixing issues with the modular reporting architecture in lust-next:

1. **Data Flow Diagnosis and Fixing**:
   - Identified issues with coverage and quality data not reaching the reporting module
   - Enhanced the `get_report_data()` functions in coverage and quality modules with diagnostic output
   - Fixed module loading mechanisms to ensure reporting module can be found in different environments
   - Added explicit calls to `coverage.calculate_stats()` to ensure data is properly processed
   - Implemented comprehensive diagnostic logging throughout the data flow

1. **File I/O Reliability Improvements**:
   - Enhanced the `ensure_directory()` function to handle more edge cases
   - Added fallback mechanisms for directory creation with direct `mkdir -p` commands
   - Improved error reporting in file operations with detailed diagnostic output
   - Fixed path handling for various environments with better cross-platform support
   - Added robust error handling in file writing operations

1. **Report Generation Enhancements**:
   - Improved the auto_save_reports functionality to handle both coverage and quality data
   - Added better error handling and fallback mechanisms when reporting module isn't found
   - Enhanced error reporting to help diagnose issues with file paths and permissions
   - Added optional debug output to track the data flow between modules
   - Maintained backward compatibility with existing report generation patterns

1. **Integration with run_tests.lua**:
   - Started updating run_tests.lua to better utilize the enhanced reporting capabilities
   - Added diagnostic output to help identify issues with module loading
   - Improved the command-line interface for better report configuration
   - Enhanced error detection and correction in the test runner
   - Fixed path handling to ensure proper module loading across environments
