## Session: 2025-03-08 - Implemented Comprehensive Filesystem Module in lust-next

1. **Created Standalone Filesystem Module**:
   - Implemented 29 filesystem functions across 5 categories in lib/tools/filesystem.lua
   - Designed for platform independence across Windows, macOS, and Linux
   - Built robust error handling with consistent return value patterns
   - Added comprehensive path manipulation utilities
   - Implemented file discovery with glob pattern support
   - Created detailed documentation in docs/api/filesystem.md

2. **Integrated with Core Modules**:
   - Refactored coverage module to use the filesystem module for file operations
   - Updated file discovery in coverage using filesystem's robust discover_files function
   - Updated quality module to use filesystem for file reading and report generation
   - Removed duplicate file handling code from both modules
   - Created example files demonstrating the integration

3. **Designed for Future Extraction**:
   - Created zero dependencies on other lust-next modules
   - Implemented completely self-contained with internal utility functions
   - Designed comprehensive test suite for all functions
   - Established plan for eventual extraction as standalone library

4. **Fixed Implementation Issues**:
   - Resolved path normalization problems with trailing slashes
   - Fixed glob pattern matching for file discovery
   - Addressed cross-platform directory operations
   - Corrected edge cases in file name extraction

## Session: 2025-03-08 - Enhanced Coverage and Test Runner in lust-next

1. **Fixed Test Runner Reporting**:
   - Fixed bug in run_all_tests.lua that incorrectly reported "ALL TESTS PASSED" when tests had assertion failures
   - Updated file pass/fail detection to consider test assertion failures, not just runtime errors
   - Enhanced failure reporting with comprehensive information about failed assertions

2. **Improved Coverage Module**:
   - Enhanced the coverage module with source file discovery capabilities
   - Implemented source_dirs configuration to specify which directories to scan
   - Added discover_uncovered flag to find files not executed by tests
   - Improved handling of include/exclude patterns with use_default_patterns flag
   - Enhanced statistics calculation to properly account for discovered files

3. **Added Documentation and Examples**:
   - Updated coverage module documentation with new options and examples
   - Updated config template with comprehensive coverage options
   - Created detailed examples showing new coverage features
   - Added examples for integrating coverage with test runner

4. **Planned Filesystem Module**:
   - Designed a comprehensive plan for a standalone filesystem module
   - Prepared for extraction to a separate module while developing within lust-next
   - Established API design with platform-independent operations
   - Planned development sequence: filesystem first, then enhance coverage and quality modules

## Session: 2025-03-08 - Integration Testing for fix_markdown.lua in lust-next

1. **Created Integration Tests for fix_markdown.lua**:
   - Implemented comprehensive test suite for fix_markdown.lua script
   - Added tests for command-line flag handling (--help, --version)
   - Created tests for processing single files, multiple files, and directories
   - Added test cases for handling files with special characters
   - Implemented tests for different fix modes (--heading-levels, --list-numbering)
   - Created robust test file creation and cleanup routines
   - Identified 5 remaining test failures to address in next session

2. **Improved Test Structure and Debugging**:
   - Implemented isolated test environment for markdown testing
   - Added detailed debugging information to diagnose test failures
   - Created file content verification to ensure transformations work
   - Added test resource cleanup after execution

3. **Established Next Steps**:
   - Identified need to fix 5 remaining integration test failures
   - Determined need for comprehensive code coverage analysis
   - Planned testing for higher level code quality validation

## Session: 2025-03-08 - Fixing Test Failures in lust-next

Fixed critical test failures in the lust-next testing framework:

1. **Fixed Module Reset Functionality**:
   - Improved module_reset_test.lua to provide proper isolation between tests
   - Added unique suffixes to module names to prevent test conflicts
   - Enhanced error handling and cleanup for temporary test modules
   - Improved package.path handling for more reliable test execution

2. **Enhanced Markdown Processing**:
   - Improved fix_markdown.lua to properly handle single file, multiple files, and directory arguments
   - Added support for mixed file and directory arguments
   - Implemented better reporting of files processed vs files fixed
   - Added tests for the new multiple file/directory handling capabilities

3. **Improved Test Assertions**:
   - Fixed enhanced_reporting_test.lua to properly use lust-next's expect assertions
   - Enhanced string pattern matching to be more reliable across different environments
   - Replaced outdated assert.not_nil calls with expect().to.exist()

4. **Documentation Updates**:
   - Improved command-line help for markdown processing tools
   - Added examples for various file and directory combinations

## Session: 2025-03-09 - JSON Test Results Formatting for Parallel Execution

Implemented JSON output markers and formatters for reliable parallel test execution:

1. **JSON Test Results Formatter**:
   - Extended existing JSON formatter to support test results
   - Created standardized format for test result data
   - Added integration with parallel execution module
   - Ensured compatibility with existing formatters

2. **Output Markers System**:
   - Implemented `RESULTS_JSON_BEGIN` and `RESULTS_JSON_END` markers
   - Added robust parsing for structured test results
   - Created pattern-matching fallback for compatibility
   - Integrated with test runner for seamless output

3. **Parallel Execution Enhancements**:
   - Improved result aggregation from worker processes
   - Enhanced error reporting from test failures
   - Fixed test count reporting in parallel mode
   - Added worker output storage for debugging

4. **Examples & Testing**:
