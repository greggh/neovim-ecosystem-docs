# Project Status

## Last Updated: March 7, 2025 - Implemented Codefix Module in lust-next

## Documentation System

**Current Status:**
Completed a comprehensive repository audit to catalog existing hooks and workflows across all projects. Designed a new base+adapter workflow architecture to reduce duplication and ensure consistent functionality while allowing for project-specific customizations. Created a detailed hooks-util enhancement specification with plans for incorporating markdown tools, implementing YAML/JSON/TOML linting, and developing a workflow templating system. Established proper implementation order (hooks-util → base-project-repo → templates → end projects) and updated all relevant documentation. Additionally, created a centralized audit report with findings and recommendations for future development.

**Key Features:**

- ✅ Tier 1: Essential Context (`ecosystem-overview.md`)
- ✅ Tier 2: Current Status (`project-status.md` and project-specific task files)
- ✅ Tier 3: Reference Materials (specifications, plans, and history)
- ✅ Formal documentation structure specification (`specs/documentation-structure.md`)
- ✅ Standardized CLAUDE.md files across all projects (updated with new paths)
- ✅ Task tracking for each project
- ✅ Comprehensive set of workflow prompts:
  - Session management: startup-prompt.md (enhanced with clear instructions), end-of-session.md
  - Core workflows: command-patterns.md, ecosystem-review.md, hooks-workflow-maintenance.md
  - System maintenance: prompts-maintenance.md
  - Development workflows: project-initialization.md (updated with Documentation project type), feature-implementation.md, bug-fixing.md, code-review.md
- ✅ Cross-reference system for improved navigation (`cross-reference.md`)
- ✅ Prompt effectiveness tracking system with metrics collection
- ✅ Technical specification template with visual diagram support
- ✅ Documentation is now a proper GitHub repository with:
  - Full CI workflow for linting and documentation building
  - Pre-commit hooks for code quality using hooks-util
  - MkDocs configuration for documentation site generation
  - Project archive system for managing history entries
  - Badges and proper README information

**Active Next Steps:**

1. Implement hooks-util enhancements based on the repository audit findings
2. Create base workflow templates and adapter configuration system
3. Develop workflow templating mechanism for merging workflows
4. Update hooks-util with markdown tools from the documentation repository
5. Add YAML, JSON, and TOML linting capabilities to hooks-util
6. Create a comprehensive update mechanism for hooks-util submodules
7. Test the enhanced hooks-util with the base-project-repo

## lust-next

**Current Version:** 0.7.4

**Current Status:**
We've successfully implemented the comprehensive Lua code quality module (codefix.lua) that integrates with hooks-util and provides advanced fixing capabilities beyond what existing tools offer. This module serves as a central component for Lua code quality across all our projects, featuring StyLua integration, Luacheck integration, and custom fixers for issues neither tool handles well. We've also created a detailed CLI interface and extensive documentation.

**Key Features:**

- ✅ Automatic test discovery
- ✅ Test filtering/tagging
- ✅ Async testing support
- ✅ Comprehensive mocking system
- ✅ Enhanced assertions
- ✅ Focused/excluded test support
- ✅ Multiple output formatting options
- ✅ Modular reporting architecture
- ✅ Module reset utilities
- ✅ Parallel async execution
- ✅ Lua code quality module (codefix.lua)

**Active Next Steps:**

1. Create comprehensive test fixtures for the codefix module
2. Develop integration tests with hooks-util
3. Document best practices for using the codefix module
4. Add auto-generation of configuration files
5. Enhance performance with batched processing
6. Implement validation mechanism for confirming fixes
7. Add metrics tracking for code quality improvements

## hooks-util

**Current Version:** 0.6.0

**Current Status:**
We've developed a comprehensive code quality plan that centralizes all linting and fixing capabilities through hooks-util and lust-next. This new approach replaces our previous task-based system with a phased implementation strategy. The plan addresses all file types (Lua, Shell, Markdown, YAML, JSON, TOML) with specific tools and integration approaches for each. We've already made progress by creating enhanced fixing scripts for Lua whitespace issues, improving Markdown fixing with better CLI options, and creating a master fix-all.sh script. We've also addressed error-prone negation patterns in Lua files and updated workflow files to use correct paths. In addition, we've created documentation for proper submodule workflows to prevent common mistakes when working with testbed projects.

**Key Features (Improvements Made):**

- Centralized code quality architecture (defined in CODE_QUALITY_PLAN.md)
- Lua codefix module implemented in lust-next
- Enhanced fixing scripts for various file types
- Pre-commit hooks for code quality (fixed infinite recursion issues)
- Shellcheck integration (improved detection across environments)
- Documentation linting (fixed template distribution issues)
- Unified approach for all file types
- Comprehensive test and fix scripts for automated quality improvement

**Active Next Steps:**

1. ✅ Implement the codefix module in lust-next
2. Create hooks-util adapter for the codefix module
3. Add auto-fixing for YAML, JSON, and TOML files
4. Develop the unified CLI interface in hooks-util
5. Create comprehensive configuration management system
6. Test the system across all adapter types
7. Deploy the enhanced code quality system to all projects
8. Document integration patterns for custom projects

## nvim-toolkit

**Current Version:** 0.1.0

**Current Status:**
Successfully implemented with all six planned modules. The library provides a comprehensive, well-documented set of utilities for Neovim plugin and configuration development.

**Key Features:**

- ✅ UI Module: Floating windows, notifications, and UI components
- ✅ Log Module: Logging with levels, rotation, and formatting
- ✅ FS Module: File operations, path handling, project root detection
- ✅ API Module: Safe Neovim API wrappers and autocmd management
- ✅ Config Module: Configuration validation and management
- ✅ Keymap Module: Fluent API for keymap management

**Active Next Steps:**
