# Project Status

## Last Updated: 2025-03-08 - Implemented Comprehensive Filesystem Module in lust-next

## Documentation System

**Current Status:**
Completed a comprehensive repository audit to catalog existing hooks and workflows across all projects. Designed a new base+adapter workflow architecture to reduce duplication and ensure consistent functionality while allowing for project-specific customizations. Created a detailed hooks-util enhancement specification with plans for incorporating markdown tools, implementing YAML/JSON/TOML linting, and developing a workflow templating system. Established proper implementation order (hooks-util → base-project-repo → templates → end projects) and updated all relevant documentation. Additionally, created a centralized audit report with findings and recommendations for future development.

**Key Features:**

- ✅ Tier 1: Essential Context (`ecosystem-overview.md`)
- ✅ Tier 2: Current Status (`project-status.md` and project-specific task files)
- ✅ Tier 3: Reference Materials (specifications, plans, and history)
- ✅ Formal documentation structure specification (`specs/documentation-structure.md`)
- ✅ Standardized CLAUDE.md files across all projects (updated with new paths)
- ✅ Task tracking for each project
- ✅ Comprehensive set of workflow prompts:
  - Session management: startup-prompt.md (enhanced with clear instructions), end-of-session.md
  - Core workflows: command-patterns.md, ecosystem-review.md, hooks-workflow-maintenance.md
  - System maintenance: prompts-maintenance.md
  - Development workflows: project-initialization.md (updated with Documentation project type), feature-implementation.md, bug-fixing.md, code-review.md
- ✅ Cross-reference system for improved navigation (`cross-reference.md`)
- ✅ Prompt effectiveness tracking system with metrics collection
- ✅ Technical specification template with visual diagram support
- ✅ Documentation is now a proper GitHub repository with:
  - Full CI workflow for linting and documentation building
  - Pre-commit hooks for code quality using hooks-util
  - MkDocs configuration for documentation site generation

**Active Next Steps:**
1. Complete remaining specialized workflow prompts for performance optimization
2. Update all project CLAUDE.md files with latest specifications
3. Create MkDocs configuration for generating comprehensive documentation site
4. Implement versioning strategy for documentation

## lust-next

**Current Status:**
Implemented a comprehensive, standalone filesystem module with 29 functions that handles file operations, directory management, path manipulation, file discovery, and information retrieval across all platforms. The module is designed with zero dependencies on other lust-next components, making it suitable for future extraction as a separate library. Integrated the filesystem module with the coverage and quality modules, removing duplicate file handling code and centralizing all file operations. The filesystem module provides robust error handling, consistent return value patterns, and platform-independent operation. All core functionality is tested and working properly with clear documentation and examples.

**Key Features:**
- ✅ Comprehensive mocking system with spy, stub, and mock implementations
- ✅ Module reset system for test isolation with configurable protection
- ✅ Enhanced markdown processing with support for files and directories
- ✅ Multiple report formats (HTML, JSON, JUnit XML, TAP, CSV)
- ✅ Interactive CLI mode with command history and live configuration
- ✅ Watch mode for continuous testing during development
- ✅ Advanced code coverage analysis with file discovery capabilities
- ✅ Asynchronous testing support with timeouts and error handling
- ✅ Accurate test result reporting with detailed assertion failure information
- ✅ Standalone filesystem module with 29 platform-independent functions
- ✅ Integrated file discovery with glob pattern support
- ✅ Robust path manipulation utilities for cross-platform operations

**Active Next Steps:**
1. Complete integration of filesystem module with reporting system
2. Update all test files to use the filesystem module
3. Expand test suite for filesystem module to cover all edge cases
4. Prepare filesystem module for eventual extraction as standalone library
5. Run higher-level code quality validation (level 5) to identify weak spots
6. Complete integration with hooks-util project

## hooks-util

**Current Status:**
Completed baseline functionality with comprehensive pre-commit hooks for multiple file types. Added support for Lua, Markdown, YAML, and shell script validation. Implemented framework-agnostic test runner with configuration options. Created a plugin system for extending functionality with custom hooks.

**Key Features:**
- ✅ Pre-commit hooks for Lua (using luacheck)
- ✅ Pre-commit hooks for Markdown (using markdownlint)
- ✅ Pre-commit hooks for YAML (using yamllint)
- ✅ Pre-commit hooks for shell scripts (using shellcheck)
- ✅ Framework-agnostic test runner with configuration
- ✅ Plugin system for custom hook implementation
- ✅ Integration with CI/CD pipelines

**Active Next Steps:**
1. Complete integration with lust-next for test running
2. Enhance Markdown processing tools with more formatting options
3. Implement TOML validation hooks
4. Create user documentation with examples
5. Set up demonstration repository with example workflows
