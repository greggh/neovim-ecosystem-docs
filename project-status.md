# Project Status

## Last Updated: March 7, 2025 - End of Day

## Documentation System

**Current Status:**  
Completely reorganized project directory structure, established proper GitHub repository for documentation, and implemented project history archiving system. All projects now follow a consistent type-based organization pattern with proper paths.

**Key Features:**

- ✅ Tier 1: Essential Context (`ecosystem-overview.md`)
- ✅ Tier 2: Current Status (`project-status.md` and project-specific task files)
- ✅ Tier 3: Reference Materials (specifications, plans, and history)
- ✅ Formal documentation structure specification (`specs/documentation-structure.md`)
- ✅ Standardized CLAUDE.md files across all projects (updated with new paths)
- ✅ Task tracking for each project
- ✅ Comprehensive set of workflow prompts:
  - Session management: startup-prompt.md (enhanced with clear instructions), end-of-session.md
  - Core workflows: command-patterns.md, ecosystem-review.md, hooks-workflow-maintenance.md
  - System maintenance: prompts-maintenance.md
  - Development workflows: project-initialization.md (updated with Documentation project type), feature-implementation.md, bug-fixing.md, code-review.md
- ✅ Cross-reference system for improved navigation (`cross-reference.md`)
- ✅ Prompt effectiveness tracking system with metrics collection
- ✅ Technical specification template with visual diagram support
- ✅ Documentation is now a proper GitHub repository with:
  - Full CI workflow for linting and documentation building
  - Pre-commit hooks for code quality using hooks-util
  - MkDocs configuration for documentation site generation
  - Project archive system for managing history entries
  - Badges and proper README information

**Active Next Steps:**

1. Create automation scripts for metrics tracking and reporting
2. Develop documentation usage guides and tutorials
3. Create examples of technical specifications with diagrams
4. Implement metrics validation tools
5. Set up monthly review process with automated reminders
6. Create deployment workflow for MkDocs site to GitHub Pages

## lust-next

- ✅ Module reset utilities
- ✅ Parallel async execution

**Active Next Steps:**

1. Create more robust test cases for edge cases of the reporting system
2. Add additional output formats (e.g., Cobertura XML)
3. Enhance HTML reports with source code highlighting
4. Create a comprehensive validation suite for module interactions
5. Add configuration support for report file naming and location specification

## hooks-util

**Current Version:** 0.5.0

**Current Status:**  
Enhanced with adapter-based architecture, Lua configuration system, and test quality validation integrated with lust-next. The framework supports different project types with specialized adapters.

**Key Features:**

- ✅ Project type detection system
- ✅ Lua-based configuration
- ✅ Multiple adapter types (Neovim plugin, config, Lua library)
- ✅ Test quality validation
- ✅ Pre-commit hooks for code quality
- ✅ Lust-next integration

**Active Next Steps:**

1. Complete comprehensive testing across all adapter types
2. Finalize documentation for the adapter system
3. Integrate as git submodule in all Neovim projects
4. Create additional adapters for specialized project types

## nvim-toolkit

**Current Version:** 0.1.0

**Current Status:**  
Successfully implemented with all six planned modules. The library provides a comprehensive, well-documented set of utilities for Neovim plugin and configuration development.

**Key Features:**

- ✅ UI Module: Floating windows, notifications, and UI components
- ✅ Log Module: Logging with levels, rotation, and formatting
- ✅ FS Module: File operations, path handling, project root detection
- ✅ API Module: Safe Neovim API wrappers and autocmd management
- ✅ Config Module: Configuration validation and management
- ✅ Keymap Module: Fluent API for keymap management

**Active Next Steps:**

1. Integrate into personal Neovim configuration
2. Integrate into Laravel Helper and Claude Code plugins
3. Expand module functionality based on real-world usage
4. Enhance documentation with more detailed examples

## Laravel Helper Plugin

**Current Version:** 0.4.2

**Current Status:**  
Stable with standardized version display. Ready for nvim-toolkit integration.

**Active Next Steps:**

1. Integrate nvim-toolkit for shared utilities
2. Add hooks-util as git submodule for development workflow
3. Expand IDE Helper integration features

## Claude Code Plugin

**Current Version:** 0.4.2

**Current Status:**  
Stable with standardized version display. Ready for nvim-toolkit integration.

**Active Next Steps:**

1. Integrate nvim-toolkit for shared utilities
2. Add hooks-util as git submodule for development workflow
3. Enhance integration with Claude Code CLI

## Base Project Template / Neovim Templates

**Current Status:**  
All templates have consistent structures, working CI workflows, and standardized documentation. Version management system is implemented across the template inheritance chain.

**Active Next Steps:**

1. Fix any remaining YAML linting issues
2. Standardize workflow files across all projects
3. Create step-by-step guide for future project creation

## Test Projects

**Current Status:**  
Four test projects have been created to validate lust-next and hooks-util functionality:

- lust-next-testbed: Updated to use modular reporting features
- hooks-util-testbed-*: Configured with appropriate project structures for adapter testing

**Active Next Steps:**

1. Execute comprehensive testing plan across all test projects
2. Document testing results and lessons learned
